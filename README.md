This project, titled Traffic Sign Recognition, is designed to automatically recognize and classify traffic signs using machine learning techniques. By analyzing images of traffic signs, the system can accurately identify their category, making it a valuable tool for applications such as driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles.

Project Overview:

The project uses the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which contains over 50,000 images of traffic signs categorized into 43 types. The dataset was processed to train a machine learning model capable of recognizing these signs from new images with a high degree of accuracy.

Purpose of the Project:

The goal of this project is to enhance road safety by developing a reliable system for recognizing traffic signs. Such a system can be implemented in smart vehicles to help them interpret traffic signs, improving navigation and preventing accidents. The project showcases how artificial intelligence can contribute to safer and smarter transportation solutions.

Features and Capabilities:

1.Traffic Sign Detection and Classification: The system uses image recognition techniques to detect and classify different traffic signs, such as stop signs, speed limits, and warning signs.

2.Data Augmentation: The training data was enhanced using techniques like rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustment to ensure the model can recognize signs from different angles and under varying conditions.

3.Machine Learning Models: Various models, including Random Forest Classifier and VGG16, were tested. The Random Forest model was chosen for its superior performance in terms of accuracy and precision.

How the System Can Be Used:

1.In Vehicles: This system can be integrated into driver assistance systems to help vehicles automatically detect and respond to traffic signs.

2.Traffic Management: It can be used in smart traffic systems to monitor and manage road signs, ensuring safety and efficiency.

3.Educational Tool: The system can also be used for educational purposes, helping learners understand how machine learning models work in real-world applications.

By recognizing traffic signs accurately, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in creating intelligent systems that contribute to safer roads and smarter vehicles.
